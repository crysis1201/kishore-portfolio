This webpage is a portfolio for my friend Kishore kumar he is a Motion Designer & Flutter developer
This site is created with react Js and Redux for state management and for animation i used framer-motion
For email Api i used Send Grid i didn't consider other choices just used it, its good for the most part
as i am using tailwindcss for the css, craco build and start is used,
i prefer tailwind over other css frameworks it got good amount of customization and its utility-class based framework
